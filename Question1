My favorite library is MPAndroidChart, is a powerful & easy to use chart library for Android.
Displaying data through charts/diagrams is essential part in most of the applications weather it is web or mobile application. MPAndroidChart makes drawing charts for mobile screens a cake walk. Charts generated by this library are supported even in old versions of Android. MPAndroidChart has some unique features like different chart types, dragging / panning (with touch-gesture), combined-Charts saving chart to SD-Card (as image, or as .txt file), animations, limit lines (for providing additional information, maximums) and itâ€™s fully customizable that makes it a must have library for drawing charts.
